certain files in UPL appear to only have "venta" registration numbers, I'm not sure if that is different.

./Diprospero.pdf
./Maestro.pdf
both have the same number, 3077

some have only images, the counts of words extracted are in text_counts.txt

recognizing tables is inherently tricky.

sharda files appear to have no registration numbers, I couldn't find 
them manually
